# Contributing to Sleek

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Sleek as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/sleek/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!
